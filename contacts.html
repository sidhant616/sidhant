                A motto is a slogan or favorite saying, like "When life hands  <br>
                you lemons, make lemonade." A motto is something you might  <br>
                see on a t-shirt or bumper sticker â€”a short sentence or <br>
                phrase that has meaning for that person. Some mottoes <br>
                have to do with politics, religion, or another belief. <br><br>
                The definition of a motto is a phrase or quote that is <br>
                representative of a person or brand's ideals and values. <br>
                 An example of a motto is Apple Computer's "Think Different" phrase. <br><br>
